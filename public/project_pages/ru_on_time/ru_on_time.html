<p>RU On Time is a mobile app that helps users develop time management skills through gamification. The app provides the
    user with pets the user can take care of through completing tasks on time, as well as a social leaderboard.</p>

<p>To track assignments, users can input assignments as well as their start and due dates in the assignments page. These
    assignments can be filtered to sort by completion status, and sort by due date. An overview of assignments can be
    viewed on the calendar page, and clicking on dates will focus on any assignments due on that day.</p>

<p>The front end was created with Flutter, and user data is stored with a Firebase backend.</p>
